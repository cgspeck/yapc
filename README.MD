# Yet Another Pushover Client

Inspired by [Ntfy](https://github.com/dschep/ntfy) & [Ntf](https://github.com/hrntknr/ntf).

* single pre-compiled binary
* uses layed config, getting settings from `/etc/default/yapc.yaml`, `~/.config/yapc.yaml` or the environment
* only supports pushover
* bash shell hook (WIP)
